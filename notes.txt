nginx -c /usr/local/etc/nginx/static-file-server.conf 


npx prisma migrate dev --name add-models  
npx prisma studio

Plans:

- save unique ID for each screenshot to DB
- retrieve URL on image load
- delete if not saved or deleted
- save form, object to DB
- load all saved objects on home page

nice to have:
- remove cookies banner (can we use AI for this?)
